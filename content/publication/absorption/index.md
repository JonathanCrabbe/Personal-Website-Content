abstract: 'Over the past decade, Deep Learning (DL) models have proven to be efficient at classifying remotely sensed Earth Observation (EO) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data. Those models show state-of-the-art performances across various bench-marked data sets by extracting abstract spatial-spectral features using 2D and 3D convolutions. However, the black-box nature of DL models hinders explanation, limits trust, and underscores the need for profound insights beyond raw performance metrics. In this contribution, we implement a simple yet powerful mechanism for the explainability of DL-based absorption features using an axiomatic approach called Integrated Gradients, and showcase how such an approach can be used to evaluate the relevance of a networkâ€™s decisions, and compare network sensitivities when trained using single and dual sensor data.'
