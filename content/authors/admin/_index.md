I am currently working towards my PhD thesis in the [Applied Mathematics Department](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. In this stimulating environment, I am learning to become a well-rounded Machine Learning researcher.

We are gradually entering in a phase where humans will increasingly interact with *generative* and *predictive AIs*, hence forming human-AI teams. I see an immense potential in these teams to approach cutting-edge *scientific* and *medical* problems. My research focuses on making these teams more efficient by improving the information flow between complex ML models and human users. This touches upon various subjects of the AI literature, including *ML Interpretability*, *Robust ML* and *Data-Centric AI*. In some sense, my goal is to build this *microscope* that would allow human beings to look inside a machine learning model. Through the interface of this microscope, human beings can *rigorously validate* ML models, *extract knowledge* from them and learn to use these models *more efficiently*.
